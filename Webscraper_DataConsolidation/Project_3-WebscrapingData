Project 3 is a data consolidation project completed for use by a 7-person team.

Situation:
The organization's current metadata downloads did not give the educational organization's curriculum team enough data to easily review and author new content without engaging in time-consuming manual searches across numerous webpages.  Some metadata existed that was useful, while other data was inaccessible via downloads.

Our dev team was too overcommitted to other fixes to even update an autosave feature on our webpage - a request for this data through our own data warehousing was left unanswered for over a month.  Because the team needed this data extracted and consolidated, it was decided that webscraping was the best approach.

Task:
Combine existing, easily-accessible data with webscraped data for additional fields into one database, allowing curriculum team members to query data as needed for their reviewing and authoring.
