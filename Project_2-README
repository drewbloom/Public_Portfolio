Project 2 is a Robotic Process Automation using Playwright in Python.

Situation:
The organization regularly audited its web content metadata.  When inconsistencies were found between the expected metadata and the actual metadata found, a spreadsheet of missing metadata mappings was produced for a team of 5 to complete.  These could be as many as 500 mappings per month and were completed via manual data entry across a series of webpages.

Task:
Create an automation to complete these metadata mappings as needed with robust fallbacks and error logs to locate issues as they arise.

Action:
Over a design and testing period of roughly one week, the first iteration of the Python script was written and began being used to run metadata mappings.  Developer updates to the web application and additional fallbacks have caused weekly updates to be implemented to address new errors and add new features to the project.

Result:
A team of 5 was saved from an hours-long monthly data entry task that can now be managed by one user and updated regularly while using less than half of the original labor costs for this task.  The hourly commitment across the team has dropped from 10 hours per month distributed across many different team members to less than 5 hours per month with only one team member accountable for the processing, reducing issues with communication and accountability.
