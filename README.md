# Public_Projects
Hey, I'm Drew Bloom, and this repository contains a series of projects demonstrating my ability to tackle tasks and arrive at solutions.

# Repository Folders
Each folder contains a particular project with a quick summary and its corresponding files.
The project summary breaks down the project in STAR format to give the viewer a sense of scope and timeframe.
The files include Python scripts, Google Apps Scripts, and sample Google Docs and Sheets that correspond with these scripts.

# Privacy and Security
The project files provided have been scrubbed of proprietary data along with adjustments to maintain privacy and security.
As such, many cannot be tested for intended functionality, but sample logs and outputs have been included where possible.
