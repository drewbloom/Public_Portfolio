This project was designed to automatically check institutional education standards for compliance with national standards.  To do this, a web application processes a file upload (pdf or Google Doc) containing the institutional standards.  It pushes the file text to be parsed by OpenAI's GPT-4o based on few-shot prompting methods to return a list of the learning objectives.  The learning objectives are added to a database (Google Sheets) and have embeddings created.  Those embeddings are compared to embeddings for the national standards, and a cosine similarity score of >0.50 is used to determine matches.  A series of functions within the sheet and within the Apps Script then create visuals and pinpoint relevant takeaways to be populated in a web application.  Finally, the Web Application returns these visuals and results of the report to the user's webpage once these processes finish on the back end.
